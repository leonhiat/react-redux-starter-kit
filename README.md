[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davezuko/wirk-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davezuko/wirk-starter/)

A basic starter kit that gives you just enough boilerplate to start building Isomorphic React applications with Koa.js, while staying out of your way.

Features
--------
* Webpack build system for client and server builds
  * Client build pre-configured to split bundle into an application and vendor bundle
  * Development script to enable live-reloading with hot module replacement
* Koa.js as a back-end server
* Jade for html pre-processing
